The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast demand for bike rentals in Seoul, South Korea, based on historical usage patterns, weather conditions, and other relevant factors. The project involves data collection, data preparation, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, model training, model evaluation, and model deployment. The project aims to help the bike-sharing program in Seoul optimize its resources, improve user satisfaction, and reduce operating costs. The project will leverage machine learning techniques and statistical analysis to build a robust and accurate predictive model that can help the bike-sharing program make data-driven decisions. The success of the project will be evaluated based on the model's ability to accurately predict bike rental demand, as well as its ability to provide valuable insights and recommendations for improving the bike-sharing program's operations. The project has the potential to not only benefit the bike-sharing program in Seoul but also serve as a model for other cities and organizations looking to optimize their resource allocation and improve their service offerings.
